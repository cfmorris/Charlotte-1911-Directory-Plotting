# Charlotte-1911-Directory-Plotting

This program was written as a project for INST742 - Implementing Digital Curation with Dr. Marciano at University of Maryland's ISchool.  It picks up with a dataset we created by using OCR on a 1911 Charlotte city registry from the Internet Archives which was cleaned using open refine.  The goal was to map the addresses we identified with associated metadata (profession, race, etc).

It was created as an instructional tool that other information scientists could use to reproduce on their own datasets and therefore was put into a Jupyter Notebook with descriptions of the process.  For the raw code please see the Charlotte-1911-code.py file.
